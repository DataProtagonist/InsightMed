# Healthcare Management Dashboard 📊

This repository contains the **Healthcare Management Dashboard** project, which focuses on providing data-driven insights for various stakeholders in the healthcare system. The project leverages data visualization tools like QlikView and Tableau to create interactive dashboards tailored for hospital management, healthcare professionals, the general public, and analysts.

## 📂 Project Overview

The **Healthcare Management Dashboard** project aims to improve decision-making and healthcare communication by presenting vaccination data and patient information in an easily understandable format. This project addresses the needs of various audience segments, including hospital management, healthcare workers, the general public, and data analysts.

### Key Stakeholders:
- **Hospital Management**: Strategic decision-making, risk management, and resource allocation.
- **Healthcare Workers**: Patient safety and treatment outcomes.
- **General Public**: Understanding vaccination trends and making informed health decisions.
- **Data Analysts**: In-depth data exploration and pattern analysis.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Provide **data-driven insights** into patient care, vaccine safety, and hospital operations.
- Create dashboards that simplify complex healthcare data for different audiences.
- Use advanced data visualization tools like **Tableau** and **QlikView** to create interactive dashboards.
- Facilitate better communication between healthcare providers and patients through clear, actionable insights.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- **Data Visualization**: Tableau and QlikView for creating interactive and tailored dashboards.
- **Data Handling**: Excel for managing and cleaning the datasets.
- **Reporting**: PDF for the final report detailing the insights from the project.

## 📊 Dashboard Insights

### Hospital Management:
Visualizations are designed to support strategic decisions:
- **Risk Analysis Bar Chart**: Displays the percentage of risk associated with different vaccines.
- **Event Distribution Table**: Breaks down vaccination events by type and demographic factors like age and gender.

### Healthcare Workers:
Visualizations provide real-time, actionable data for healthcare workers:
- **Adverse Event Frequency Bar Chart**: Ranks vaccines based on the frequency of adverse events.
- **Circle View of Adverse Events**: Uses circles to represent the relative risk of vaccines, making it easy for healthcare workers to quickly assess patient safety.

### Lay Public:
Visualizations make healthcare data more accessible:
- **Age-Demographic Bar Chart**: Breaks down vaccination data by age group and gender, making it easy for the public to understand relevant risks.
- **Side-by-Side Circle Visualization**: Compares vaccine risks across populations using visually appealing graphics.

### Analysts:
In-depth visualizations for data exploration and analysis:
- **Demographic Bar Chart**: Provides a detailed breakdown of adverse events by age and gender.
- **Radar Chart**: Visualizes risk percentages across age groups, allowing for pattern detection in vaccine safety.

## 📄 Project Report and Dashboards

- **Final Report**: The detailed project report (`Project Report.pdf`) outlines the healthcare data analysis and dashboard insights.
- **Tableau Dashboard**: The `Hospital management.twb` file contains interactive visualizations tailored for hospital management.
- **QlikView Dashboards**: The `Healthcare Activity - Starter.qvw` and `hospital management 1.qvf` files offer different perspectives on healthcare data.

## 💻 Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-management-dashboard.git
   ```
2. Open the QlikView Dashboards: Use QlikView to open Healthcare Activity - Starter.qvw and hospital management 1.qvf to explore the visualizations.

3. Open the Tableau Dashboard: Use Tableau Desktop to open Hospital management.twb and interact with the visualizations.

4. Review the Project Report: Open Project Report.pdf to review the detailed findings and insights from the project.


### Next Steps:

1. **Upload Files**: 
   - Place the Excel files (`Healthcare.xlsx`, `Patient.xlsx`), QlikView files (`Healthcare Activity - Starter.qvw`, `hospital management 1.qvf`), and Tableau Workbook (`Hospital management.twb`) into the appropriate folders.

2. **Push to GitHub**: 
   - Once everything is structured, push the repository to GitHub.

3. **Set up CI/CD** (Optional):
   - You can set up a CI/CD pipeline if needed to automate tasks like data testing or dashboard deployment.

Once the repository is set up, it will be well-organized and ready for collaboration or showcasing. Let me know if you need help with any other aspects!
